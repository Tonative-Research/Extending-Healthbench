# Extending-Healthbench
## Research Overview
Exttending HealthBench is a research project focused on improving the safety, accuracy, and cultural relevance of medical AI systems for African communities.

Today, nearly all medical evaluation datasets (including the original OpenAI HealthBench) exist only in English. This results in:

Models producing unsafe or incorrect medical outputs when used in African languages

Lack of evaluation tools for African languages

Inability for researchers to measure how well LLMs perform in real local contexts
