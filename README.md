# Extending-Healthbench
## Research Overview
Exttending HealthBench is a research project focused on improving the safety, accuracy, and cultural relevance of medical AI systems for African communities.

Today, nearly all medical evaluation datasets (including the original OpenAI HealthBench) exist only in English. This results in:

- Models producing unsafe or incorrect medical outputs when used in African languages
- Lack of evaluation tools for African languages
- Inability for researchers to measure how well LLMs perform in real local contexts
  
Our project addresses these gaps by building the first multilingual medical AI evaluation benchmark for African languages, starting with:
- Igbo
- Yoruba
- Nigerian Pidgin
- Kikuyu
- Swahili
  
We combine LLM-as-judge evaluations and human medical expert evaluations to measure safety, correctness, and usability across languages.
## Why this matters
Medical AI is becoming increasingly influential yet African languages remain underrepresented. This causes:
- Misinformation in medical conversations
- Wrong dosage instructions
- Misunderstandings in lower-literacy communities
- Reduced trust in AI health tools

By building a multilingual benchmark, we enable:
- Safer, locally-relevant medical AI systems
- Better tools for African NLP researchers
- Evaluation methods tailored to real-world African health contexts
- A baseline for future medical AI development in African languages
